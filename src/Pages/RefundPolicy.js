          Replacement &amp; Refunds
        </p>
        <p>
          We have a simple and easy replacement policy; our customer can always
          make a claim for valid reasons. We make sure we deliver the
          high-quality products to you, still we expect rare scenarios of
          dissatisfaction regarding the defects, damages, freshness, quality,
          quantity, pricing &amp; packing issues of received items where
          customers can report the case within 24 hours to our customer support
          team. Since we place customers first, we assure a full refund /
          replacement if the customer is not satisfied with the products. In
          case of refund, the amount will be credited to the same account or
          payment made.
